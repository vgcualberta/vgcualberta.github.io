            <h2>Our Next Event</h2>
            <p>The club is currently on break for the summer term as we're cooped up at home playing games. Keep your eyes out in Fall 2020 for future events!</p>
            <p>Here at the Video Gaming Club, or VGC, we strive to create a tight-knit community for UofA folks to share their passion for video gaming.
            We welcome all fans/players, casual or competitive, of all sorts of video games. We host game nights and game tournaments, and we have so much more in store.
            Drop by during our events, and maybe even become a member! </p>
            <p>Join VGC</p>
